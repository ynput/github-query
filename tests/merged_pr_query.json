Now, the newer values will apply when enabled by default.\r\n\r\nIf the setting was overridden explicitly to disabled it will now log a message that the AYON Maya workfile color management is disabled.\r\n\r\n## Additional info\r\n<!-- Paragraphs of text giving context of additional technical information or code examples. -->\r\n\r\nThis was \"deprecated\" since OpenPype 3.15.5.\r\n\r\nAlso removed the legacy OCIO config settings that were for Maya 2020 and older since those are Py2 anyway and are already unsupported.\r\n\r\n## Testing notes:\r\n\r\n1. Test whether the color management settings work and apply as you'd expect\r\n2. Preferably you also test how this influences older projects from before and highlight where the issues may appear.\r\n",

There's an edge case where Maya returns `None` for string attributes that have no values set - those are captured now explicitly to just `\"\"` to still collect and apply them later.\r\n\r\nExisting looks will now also apply correctly with `None` value in their look attributes, but the attributes with `None` values will be ignored with a warning.\r\n\r\n## Additional info\r\n<!-- Paragraphs of text giving context of additional technical information or code examples. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing notes:\r\n\r\n1. Load a model reference\r\n2. Create a string attribute, e.g. `test`\r\n3. Do not set any value for it.\r\n    - Maya will return None for this attribute, e.g. select the object and run:\r\n```python\r\nfrom maya import cmds\r\nprint(cmds.getAttr(\".test\"))\r\n```\r\nIt will print `None`.\r\n4. Publish the look for this mesh\r\n5. The published `.json` file should have attribute value for `test` set to `\"\"`\r\n\r\nTo test the 'backwards compatible fix':\r\n- Publish the same look with `develop` branch. The value will be `null` in the `.json` file.`\r\n- OR, just open the last published `.json` file, and edit the `\"\"` value to `null`\r\n\r\nThen, confirm that applying the look succeeds without errors but with a warning regarding the `None` value when applying with this PR. For example in my test run it logged:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Warning: ayon_maya.api.lib : Skipping setting |_GRP|cube_GEO.test with value 'None'\r\n```",
